Esports Fall 2023

If you're reading this, you're likely interested in participating in a fall esports program. Due to COVID issues and last year's fire, we have been relatively inactive, but we're excited to get started again. The MPA fall esports program typically begins within the first two weeks of school. To gauge interest in the fall 2023 program, we would like to find out who is interested and how many students would like to participate.

One of the biggest challenges with high school esports is the cost. We do not know what support we will receive from WHS, and it is possible that all players will need to cover the cost of competitions, costs for participation are as follows:

For MPA/ PlayVs:

$80 per player
About $1500 per season for unlimited participation

For HSEL:
$45 per player
$750 per season

If you wish to play multiple games, we will have to join both groups.

All competitions take place after school Tuesday through Friday usually from 3 to 6 pm. Competition lasts for eight weeks with one to two buy week. Rules have changed but there is a possibility that all matches will need to be held in the computer lab in Room 13. Competition days depend on the games being played and schedules are known up to a week in advance. Matches can last anywhere from 30 minutes for a quick Rocket League match to 90 minutes for League.

The MPA offers competitions for traditional college esports titles at the varsity level:

League of Legends
Super Smash Bros Ultimate
Rocket League

This can change depending on the amount of schools participating.

For titles that do not have enough state teams for MPA competition, the regional groups use PlayVs Regional Structure. These titles include:

Splatoon 3
Mario Kart 8
Hearthstone
Overwatch 2
Madden NFL
NBA 2K

We can participate in the High School Esports League (HSEL), which is not a MPA sanctioned league. However all cost and times vary from MPA/PlayVS, theyâ€™re offers:

Rocket League
Minecraft
League of Legends
Brawlhalla
CS:GO
Chess
Rainbow 6 (PC)
Rainbow 6 (console)
Halo: Infinite
Valorant



We hope this information is helpful to you.  We  will need to find access to our own devices for Nintendo and consoles. I have relatively updated Laptops for PC games. If you're interested in participating, please let us know your name, contact information, and which games you would like to play. We look forward to hearing from you and starting another great season of high school esports.
